# This is a pip install -r requirements file for the key store.

# For installing the CLI interface only, using apt is probably best:
#
# apt-get install python-gpgme                  # enc=gpg
# apt-get install python-crypto python-pyasn1   # enc=sshrsa (old)

# For installing the server, you need the above, and this:
#
# apt-get install python-mysqldb

# Uncomment items below if you're not using apt. See also the
# --system-site-packages mkvirtualenv flag.)

Django>=1.3,<1.5	# python-django (built with 1.4, 1.3 works)
#MySQL-python>=1.2.4	# python-mysqldb (requires: python-dev libmysqlclient-dev)
# 1.2.4 is needed for tests, older is fine for production,
# or you could choose a different database backend...

# for gpg key type:
#gpg>=1.10		# python-gpg
# (or.. old/obsolete)
#pygpgme>=0.1		# python-gpgme (requires: python-dev libgpgme11-dev)

# for sshrsa key type:
#pyasn1>=0.0.8a		# python-pyasn1
#pycrypto>=2.0.1	# python-crypto
