# This is a pip install -r requirements file.

# For installing the CLI interface only, using apt is probably best:
#
# apt-get install python-gpgme                  # enc=gpg
# apt-get install python-crypto python-pyasn1   # enc=sshrsa (old)

## For the back-end / key store ##

Django>=1.3,<1.5	# python-django (built with 1.4, 1.3 works)
MySQL-python>=1.2.4	# python-mysqldb (requires libmysqlclient-dev)
# 1.2.4 is needed for tests, older is fine for production,
# or you could choose a different database backend...

# for gpg key type:
pygpgme>=0.1		# python-gpgme (requires libgpgme11-dev)

# for sshrsa key type:
pyasn1>=0.0.8a		# python-pyasn1
pycrypto>=2.0.1		# python-crypto
