=========================================

The list of changes.


2017-08-25: 1.2.0
-----------------
 * #1: CLI -c create on an existing object now fails as expected.
 * #5: CLI client is now Python3 compatible. Also fix issue with certain
   binary output.

 * #10/#18: Be more tolerant of +excess +users.
 * #15: Ignore SIGPIPE on stdout.
 * #17: CLI search which gets too many results now shows clear error.
 * Fix python3 support for the CLI.

2016-06-02: 1.1.3
-----------------
 * Add example workaround in settings.template so we can run with
   DEBUG=True on MySQL without getting "Invalid utf8 character string"
   errors. Reported by Devhouse Spindle.

2015-10-14: 1.1.2
-----------------
 * Remove `download_url` from setup.py as part of PEP470 change for
   PyPI.

2015-05-26: 1.1.1
-----------------
 * Fix property list problem: superusers would see more properties
   than expected with options -a -pl.

2015-05-21: 1.1.0
-----------------
 * Begin making a few error messages more friendly.
 * Alter property listing to show multiline properties in an indented
   fashion.
 * A bit of cleanup.
 * Add property search using -s.

2013-10-10: 1.0.3
-----------------
 * Messages to auth.log get a proper prefix.
 * Attempt to fix the problem of people running out of nonces.
 * Shave 50% off the time of the regular listing by reducing the amount
   of queries.
 * Don't send out properties over the mail (after deletion) even if they
   are encrypted. Log them in the admin log instead.
 * Fix so we can encrypt new properties. Version 1.0.2 is broken.

2013-10-08: 1.0.2
-----------------
 * Fix bad exception thrown when trying to add non-existent users.
   Reported by Herman :)
 * Escape slashes in URLs not with the regular percent-encoding but
   with an equals sign instead. This was needed because the WSGI spec
   does not provide a compatible way to read the escaped URI. Now you
   can use slashes in object identifiers and property names again.
 * Remove a single trailing line feed if input comes from a TTY. Add
   a single trailing line feed if output goes to a TTY.

2013-08-02: 1.0.1
