List of items to do
===================

* Need to get rid of the INFO/NOTICE messages..

* Allow multiple contexts in .pstorerc (-t contextX) to switch between
  different store-urls quickly.
* Fix .pstorerc parsing to (a) not require -- before the args. And allow
  leading '#' to comment out stuff. And have leading "[contextX]"
  headings. This should backward compatibility with older pstorerc's.

* If a response returns 500, we should redo the nonce request on the other
  server too, right?

* Document that the admin interface uses CSRF protection even though we
  don't use the middleware.
* Document that the session does not get created unless "needed", so we
  don't need a @session_exempt.

* Make revoking permissions more efficient.
* Make adding permissions more efficient (only add 1).

* When a user is inactive, he is still in the object userlist: but we do not get
  its key when adding/revoking permissions: we cannot rewrite items. Test and
  fix that.

* Rate-limit the nonce check by IP. Or add some other method to avoid DoS by
  annoying users.

* Add more verbose audit logs for all mutable operations. Use the django_admin_log?
* Log all permission-denied-errors to auth.log. Move all auth-log writing to
  readable log statements, and leave only the decorators for views that aren't
  cleaned up yet.
* Do we need to add a post-success-view audit log? Or a post-failure-view log entry?

* Document that you may want to keep some kind of history using database dumps.
* Add manpage.

* Add more property functions:
  - propdel
  - propgetall (to disk)
  - propsetall (from disk)

* Add a templating system:
  - ssl templates: bundle/pem/csr/key/crt
  - company templates: kvk-nummer, btw-nummer, address
  - ...
  - ssh templates: private ssh keys + HOOKS to add/update the public keys on the remote system
    (now we can use ssh -i instead of the password-hack)

* Devise a way in the interface to mark users a non-writers.

* Check that the schema.sql is still up to date.
* Check that https with bad cert gets a warning/error.


=INTERFACE=

* Make args [object] [property] without command equal -pg.

* Make -pe and -ps work even though no object existed yet.


=SSH HACKS=

* Make it easier to install the ssh hacks.

* For the ssh auto-login: modify pstore to act as ssh_askpass when invoked
  with SSH_PASSWORD in the environment.

* For the ssh auto-login hack: add another env var with completely random
  rot-N digits. That way we can store a randomized password on-disk:
  the SSH_RANDOM environment will be completely random (and useless) and the
  password which is very briefly written to disk will be obfuscated (pretty
  unusable without SSH_RANDOM).


=LATER OR NOT=

* Use READ_COMMITTED serialization. We can use that to abort when multiple users
  are attempting to modify the same objects at the same time. (TESTME?)

* Make it easier to install the bash_completion script (and/or complement the
  INSTALL).

* Make it easier for people to update their public key? Or describe how one can
  do it effectively in the FAQ.

* Ensure that we cannot get races when someone uploads a new public key
  and we upload a new password: have a check on at-password-upload-time
  that checks the created/modified time of all relevant publickey objects.
